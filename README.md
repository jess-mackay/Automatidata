# Course Projects for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate
This notebook contains the end-of-course projects for courses 2-6 of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate. 
I combined all projects into one notebook for ease of reference -- they all use the same dataset. Some of the steps were repeated across multiple projects, in which case I removed the repeated steps.
For the projects, I first had to follow the steps myself. I was given instructions and then further hints if needed. I then could check my code and responses against an exemplar. In this notebook, I combined my own work with the work from the exemplars so that I have an ideal reference document for future work (NOTE: the work is not enitrely my own). 
## The Data
This project uses a dataset called `2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv`. It is data gathered by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission and published by the city of New York as part of their NYC Open Data program. In order to improve the learning experience and shorten runtimes, a sample was drawn from the 113 million rows in the 2017 Yellow Taxi Trip Data table.
