## Course Projects: Automatidata
This notebook contains all end-of-course projects for courses 2-6 of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate. 
I combined all projects into one notebook for ease of reference -- they all use the same dataset. Some of the steps were repeated across multiple projects, in which case I removed the repeated steps.
For the projects, I first had to follow the steps myself. I was given instructions and then further hints if needed. I then could check my code and responses against an exemplar. In this notebook, I combined my own work with the work from the exemplars so that I have an ideal reference document for future work (NOTE: the work is not enitrely my own).
